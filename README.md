Welcome to Tar Heel Dev Studio, the home of the hardest damn workin agency around. Currently, I am a one man freelance company that offers software development, design, and marketing solutions for small businesses and entrepreneurs, but I am always looking to expand for opportunities that make sense. If you are a self-starter and have a skillset that can complement mine, I am open to partnering up in order to grow the business.

Hit me up if you are interested in working together.

I also hire freelancers when appropriate so stay tuned for any opportunities and feel free to become active with any open source stuff that is available to work on - that is the best way to get priority for any future openings.

## This site is a work in progress

I am getting back into the swing of things with Tar Heel Dev Studio, so this is a work in progress. Thank you for understanding - if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at <andrew@geauxweisbeck4.dev>.
